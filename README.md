# grp
grp is a cli grep tool written in C for searching text patterns in files.It is built so as to understand the inner workings of grep.As of now what grp does is:-

- Find text patterns that start with a specific sequence in the beggining
- Find text patterns that contains  a specific character
- Find text patterns that contains of all expressions
- Find text patterns that contains a digit

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Compile the main file by running the following the command : `gcc -o grp grp.c`
3. After compiling the files, run the executable:`grp.exe`   


## Usage

Once the program is running, you can enter commands in the shell prompt. Here are some examples:

- For finding text with a particular sequence in the beggining

## System requirements
- Windows 7 or higher
- linux
- Gcc compiler

## Roadmap 
- Finding text patterns ending with a paticular sequence
- Finding patterns of more than one file simultaneously
- Case insensitive search
- Case sensitive search
